        We use PyTorch and LangChain frameworks along with multiple large
        language models, each assigned to specific tasks, to create highly
        customized chatbots. We extensively fine-tune these models to ensure
        they are optimally suited for each business&apos;s specific
        requirements. Additionally, at GeekPie AI, we utilize vector databases
        like Astra DB, as well as AWS, Next.js, React.js, React Native, and
        Flask frameworks.
